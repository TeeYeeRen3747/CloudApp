### :scroll: BmiP

<div align="center"><img src="image/logo.png" width=160></div>
Our application works as a program that acquires user information and uses the information to monitor the user's health, such as measuring the user's body mass index and tracking the status of user's blood pressure. A pie chart could be generated to show the user's BMI falls under which category once the user has completed their BMI measurement and the percentage of that particular category among all of the users of this application.

### :pushpin: How we implement the app 

#### :paperclip: Step 1 : Understand the requirements of the project

We followed the project guidelines given by the instructor and drafted the application structure. In the first stage of development, all requirements described in the project guidelines are under discussion. 

#### :paperclip: Step 2 : Create a private repository on Github

Based on the project guideline, all of our documentation related to this app must be uploaded to Github. Therefore, we have created a private repository on Github, and all of the project members were invited. 

#### :paperclip: Step 3 : Task distribution

In order to achieve effective team cooperation, our leaders distribute tasks among each member equally. Table below shows each of the tasks handle by which member.

#### :paperclip: Step 4 : Progress update

We used social media platform like WhatsApp as our main communication tool and all the group meeting announcements will be posted in that WhatsApp group. If we have the group meeting, we will either choose Google meet or Zoom to be used. However, all the files export from MIT App Inventor will be uploaded to Github and share among other members for the progress update.  

#### :paperclip: Step 5 : App testing

After we finalize the development stage of the app, we turn our role as a user to test out the functionality of the application. We try to eliminate all the errors and minimize the inconvenient parts from user perspertive. Besides, we have to ensure the activity flows within the app are matched with what we planned at the beginning, and all the validation process are reasonable.

#### :paperclip: Step 6 : Documentation

README.md and UsageManual.md are prepare in Github purposely for reader to understand this project and get to know how this app functions.

### :computer: Tools we used to implement the app

#### 1. MIT App Inventor  

MIT App Inventor is a network application integrated development environment. In this project we used MIT App Inventor to develop the BmiP Cloud Application.
<div align="center"><img src="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/sites/explore.appinventor.mit.edu/files/blog/ai-bee-horiz.png" width=200></div>
App Inventor allows developers to create Android applications using a web browser and either a connected phone or an emulator. The App Inventor servers save the work of developers and assist them in keeping track of their projects.

<br> Developers build apps by working with:

**:white_check_mark: The App Inventor Designer**, where developer select the components for their app. <br><br>
**:white_check_mark: The App Inventor Blocks Editor**, where developer assemble program blocks that specify how the components should behave. Developer can assemble programs visually, fitting pieces together like pieces of a puzzle. 
<br> 

The App Inventor development environment is compatible with the Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, and Windows operating systems, as well as a variety of popular Android phone types. App Inventor applications can be loaded on any Android phone.
*<br> <br> Before the developer can use App Inventor, they must first configure their machine and install the App Inventor Setup package.*

#### 2. Google Sheet  

<div align="center"><img src="https://www.nicepng.com/png/detail/335-3352801_google-sheets-logo-google-sheets-logo-png.png" width=200></div>
The Google Sheet was used in this project to interact with MIT inventor to store and retrieve data. Google Sheets is a collaborative application that enables for real-time collaborative spreadsheet manipulation. Documents may be shared, accessed, and edited by several users concurrently, and users can see character-by-character changes while other collaborators amend them. Changes are automatically saved to Google's servers, and a revision history is kept so that prior adjustments may be seen and undone.
