### :pushpin: How we implement the app 

#### :paperclip: Step 1 : Understand the requirements of the project

We followed the project guidelines given by the instructor and drafted the application structure. In the first stage of development, all requirements described in the project guidelines are under discussion. 

#### :paperclip: Step 2 : Create a private repository on Github

Based on the project guideline, all of our documentation related to this app must be uploaded to Github. Therefore, we have created a private repository on Github, and all of the project members were invited. 

#### :paperclip: Step 3 : Task distribution

In order to achieve effective team cooperation, our leaders distribute tasks among each member equally. Table below shows each of the tasks handle by which member.

#### :paperclip: Step 4 : Progress update

We used social media platform like WhatsApp as our main communication tool and all the group meeting announcements will be posted in that WhatsApp group. If we have the group meeting, we will either choose Google meet or Zoom to be used. However, all the files export from MIT App Inventor will be uploaded to Github and share among other members for the progress update.  

#### :paperclip: Step 5 : App testing

After we finalize the development stage of the app, we turn our role as a user to test out the functionality of the application. We try to eliminate all the errors and minimize the inconvenient parts from user perspertive. Besides, we have to ensure the activity flows within the app are matched with what we planned at the beginning, and all the validation process are reasonable.

#### :paperclip: Step 6 : Documentation

### :computer: Tools we used to implement the app

#### 1. MIT App Inventor  

MIT App Inventor is a network application integrated development environment. In this project we used MIT App Inventor to develop the BmiP Cloud Application.

App Inventor lets developers develop applications for Android phones using a web browser and either a connected phone or emulator. The App Inventor servers store developer's work and help them keep track of their projects.

<br> Developers build apps by working with:

**:white_check_mark: The App Inventor Designer**, where developer select the components for their app. <br><br>
**:white_check_mark: The App Inventor Blocks Editor**, where developer assemble program blocks that specify how the components should behave. Developer can assemble programs visually, fitting pieces together like pieces of a puzzle. 
<br> 

The App Inventor development environment is supported for Mac OS X, GNU/Linux, and Windows operating systems, and several popular Android phone models. Applications created with App Inventor can be installed on any Android phone.
*<br> <br> Before the developer can use App Inventor, they need to set up their computer and install the App Inventor Setup package on their computer.*
